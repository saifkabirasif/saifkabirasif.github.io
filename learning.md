title: My Learning Logs
subtitle: Knowledge is the ultimate treasure! Recognitions are byproducts!!
---

I believe that knowledge is the ultimate treasure and it should not be confined by mere academic boundaries imposed by  ancient people. With democratization of learning, it has never been this easier as it is now. A new topic needs just the willingness and attention to learn, all other resources are waiting there for anyone who knows where to look for it.

This is my non-exhaustive learning log with verifiable links  - not only to show off (obvious for a mere mortal) what I have learned so far but also to remind me of how they had profound positive impact on my life thus far.
